1. Install Docker on your workstation (see instructions). Make sure you're on the latest version of docker-compose.
2. Run the following commands in your terminal:

<Note>
  Set `USER_PASSWORD`, `USER_EMAIL`, `USER_FIRSTNAME`, `USER_LASTNAME` and
  `CREATE_DEFAULT_USER` variables in the .env file so that you can create a
  default user.
</Note>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/poozlehq/engine.git
cd engine
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Wait for server to start. You can look for this log in the server logs `Nest application successfully started`.
4. Create user using the following commands

<Note>You can get server container id using `docker ps`</Note>

```bash
docker exec -it <server-container-id> sh
yarn create-default-user
```

4. You can now check poozle at `http://localhost:8000`
