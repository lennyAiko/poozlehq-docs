1. Install Docker on your workstation (see instructions). Make sure you're on the latest version of docker-compose.
2. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/poozlehq/engine.git
cd engine
docker-compose up
```

3. Create user using the following command

```bash
docker-compose run server yarn create-default-user
```

<Note>
  For the above command to work you need to set `USER_PASSWORD`, `USER_EMAIL`
  and `CREATE_DEFAULT_USER` variables set in the .env file.

Also you will use the above to login

</Note>

4. You can now check poozle at `http://localhost:8000`
